Extendables - An Alternative to Mix-ins
=========================================

Extendables are a way to extend the functionality of an object. So, for example, if you've created a book object and you want
it to be ``read`` able, you'd instantiate the ``Readable`` extendable and set it to the ``readable`` property on the book object.

.. autoclass:: avalon.Readable
.. autoclass:: avalon.Surface
